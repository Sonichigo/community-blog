## Introduction:

Codition Coverage is a popular testing technique that provides insights into the percentage of branches executed during testing.

In this article, we'll explore what is Branch Coverage, Its importance, How it works, and many more!

So Without delaying further, let's Start!

## What is Condition Coverage?

Condition coverage in software testing is also known as Predicate [Coverage.](http://coverage.it/) It guarantees that testing includes the execution of both branches in a decision, like an if statement. If a decision point has different conditions (using AND or OR), Condition coverage makes sure we've tested all the different combinations of conditions.

> *Condition Coverage = (Number of tested conditions / Total number of conditions) \* 100*

This metric gives a percentage that indicates the proportion of branches executed during testing.

Let's understand this with an example:

```javascript
function checkNumberSign(number) {
    let result;

    if (number > 0) {
        result = "Positive";
    } else if (number < 0) {
        result = "Negative";
    } else {
        result = "Zero";
    }

    return result;
}
```

In this function we have a decision point with three conditions:

1. number &gt; 0 (positive)
    
2. number &lt; 0 (negative)
    
3. number === 0 (zero)
    

For complete condition coverage (100%), ensure that your test cases cover all potential outcomes of these conditions.

## How it Works:

Now, Let's Understand how condition coverage actually works!

1. Firstly, it finds parts of our code where it makes decisions, like using "if" statements.
    
2. Then Understand each condition in the data points and Break them down into simpler parts.
    
3. Create tests that cover both sides of each condition â€“ what happens when it's true and when it's false
    
4. It runs all our tests and generates a coverage report that indicates which conditions it covers and which ones it doesn't.
    

## Benefits:

1. It ensures that our test cases have checked all the conditions or not!
    
2. With Condtion Coverage we can detect bugs in a early stage an can fix them first hand.
    
3. Thorough testing of all possible conditions improves the reliability and maintainability of the software.
    
4. Thorough testing lowers the risks of errors, improves the quality of our tests, and helps meet quality standards.
    
5. Well-tested conditions make it easier to find and fix problems, making our troubleshooting process more efficient.
