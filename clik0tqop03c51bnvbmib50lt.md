## Some case studies
API use has increased 13x since 2007

[API Friends](https://blog.axway.com/learning-center/apis/api-management/different-types-apis), a community for those involved with APIs, explains that there are 4 main types of APIS

**1-open APIs**: open APIs can also be called as Public APIs. As the name implies they are publically available for everyone to use.

**2-Partner APIs**: Sometimes Companies give limited access of their services to users via some other platforms through integrations

**3-Internal APIs**: They are also known as private APIs which are used internally within the company

**4-Composite APIs**: The fourth main type, Composite APIs, can put together multiple streams of data or actions into one API, rather than needing separate APIs for each component

## Few things which will get difficult without APIs

With APIs, we get an option to add a like button on your website which can automatically divert your like to that one Facebook post. If APIs were not there then for the same thing we need to instruct users to go to their Facebook then come on our Facebook page and like that particular post

With APIs we can click on the share button and LinkedIn will share that post on our profile but without APIs, we need to copy that post and then we need to post it manually on our profile

## Few interesting incidents

During Flipkart Big Billion day sale, over 66.6 crore visits were recorded and Flipkart APIs handled 100 orders per second.
