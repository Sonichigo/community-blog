## Introduction

In today's world, every organization wants a scalable application that never breaks on a large amount of users. Testing in Production (TiP) helps you to focus on a few areas of the functionalities used in the application that usually remain unscripted.

## **Understanding** Testing in Production (TiP)

**First of all, I want to be clear on this**: testing in production is not releasing untested code in the hope that it works and/or waiting for the bugs to be detected once it is being used by end-users. Testing in production might sound like a developer or tester’s worst nightmare. However, in the tech industry, testing in production is becoming more and more prevalent even though many people are still skeptical about the whole issue.

Testing an application in production is a critical process that ensures the software functions as expected when it’s live and being used by real users.

## How TiP **Environment be Performed?**

Let's understand How testing in a production environment is performed on the live application.

The testing team should be encouraged to integrate production testing into their daily testing cycle. An excellent way is to create a daily sanity checklist for the production testing that covers all the main functionalities of the application. Also, the modules in the application can be divided into small chunks and distributed among the testing team to test and check for the quality of the application.

**For example**, let’s say that some changes have been made to the “Cart” feature of an e-commerce website. To gauge if the changes lead to higher checkout rates. It would involve releasing two versions of the site. Version A would be the original – with no changes to the Cart. Version B would be released with the changes, which is known as **A/B testing.**

## How Keploy Test Application in Production?

Let's Understand Keploy first, Keploy is an open-source no-code **E2E Testing** Platform that generates test cases and data mocks from real user traffic🛠️.

> It creates test cases and data mocks/stubs from user-traffic by recording API calls and DB queries, significantly speeding up releases and enhancing reliability📈.

Keploy automates the process of generating test cases and makes it easier for the maintainers to maintain the test cases efficiently. It works as a proxy between the client and server who are recording and keeps noting the API interactions and expected responses and after that, it will generate the test cases and data mocks based on the API interaction and expected response.

The great thing about Keploy is, it has two modes.:

* The first mode is for **record-mode and** is for recording API interaction.
    
* The second mode is **test-mode** is for testing the application on the test cases generated by Keploy.

In the above diagram, you can see How Keploy records Test Cases and Data Mocks in production and Keploy makes it easy to switch the application from version v2 to v3.

## **Conclusion**

Testing in Production (TiP) is essential for real-world application reliability. Keploy, an open-source E2E testing platform, simplifies this process by recording API interactions, generating test cases, and supporting seamless version transitions. Embracing TiP with tools like Keploy reflects a proactive approach to ensuring software scalability and resilience.
