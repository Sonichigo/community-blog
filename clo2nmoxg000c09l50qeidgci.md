### Development -&gt; Integration -&gt;Testing -&gt; Deployment

### What is Testing

Software testing is like giving a final check to make sure our software works smoothly, as mentioned in the article above. We do this by trying out different things: developers write some tests by hand, users play around with the software, and we also have special tools that help us test automatically. This testing phase helps us find and fix any problems or mistakes in the software before it's used by everyone. It's like making sure a car runs perfectly before letting it out on the road.

Think of software testing as the part where we make sure everything is okay before we share our software with the world. As explained earlier, it's all about making sure the software works correctly. We do different kinds of tests, involving developers, users, and automation tools, to catch any issues and make the software ready for everyday use. This step is super important in the journey from creating software to making it available to users, making sure it's reliable and bug-free.

### **Software Development Life Cycle: From Developer to Production**

**Development Environment (Developer's Workspace):** This is where individual developers write and test code on their local computers.

**Development Integration Environment:** Developers use this remote environment to merge and validate their code changes collaboratively, avoiding conflicts.

**Test Environments:** These are dedicated environments for conducting both manual and automated tests to ensure the software functions correctly.

**Staging Environment:** Before deploying new code to production, it undergoes testing in this environment for acceptance and compatibility.

**Production Environment:** The final environment where the software is made available to end-users.

**Development Phase**

**Development Phase:** This phase begins when developers start coding on their own servers or personal computers. During this phase, individual developers work on writing and testing code for specific features or components.

**Integration Phase:** In this phase, all the code created by various developers on their respective servers or PCs is integrated. This ensures that different parts of the software can work together cohesively. It's a critical step for detecting and resolving any conflicts or issues that may arise when combining code from different sources or functions.

**Testing Is a Significant Phase**

Testing is a significant phase in the software development process, encompassing various types such as unit testing, system integration testing, automation, performance testing, and more.

Testing serves the crucial purpose of evaluating whether your code is ready to go live in production. Some testing is carried out by developers who manually write test cases or create test scenarios. Users themselves may also conduct certain types of testing, while automation plays a vital role in other cases.

Testing plays a critical role in identifying whether the written code is production-ready and whether it covers all possible scenarios and edge cases.

**Production or Deployment Phase**

This is the phase where the code goes live on the server, and the application becomes available to all users. Anyone can use our application as per their permissions.
